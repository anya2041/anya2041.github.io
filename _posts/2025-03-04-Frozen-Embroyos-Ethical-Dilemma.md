Introduction
A few days ago, I stumbled upon an article in MIT Technology Review that stopped me in my tracks. It wasn’t about the latest AI breakthrough or a futuristic gadget—it was something far more profound and personal: the growing number of frozen embryos worldwide, sitting in cryopreservation tanks, caught in a strange limbo between potential life and uncertainty. The piece explored the ethical, legal, and emotional complexities surrounding these tiny clusters of cells, which hold so much promise yet remain shrouded in ambiguity. As someone who has always been fascinated by the intersection of science, ethics, and humanity, I couldn’t help but dive deeper into this topic.

What struck me most was how deeply polarizing the issue is. On one side, there are those who view embryos as nothing more than microscopic collections of cells—biological material with no intrinsic value until implanted into a uterus. On the other hand, some see them as nascent human beings, deserving of protection and care from the moment they’re created. And then, of course, there’s everyone else somewhere in between, grappling with questions that don’t have easy answers.
