Introduction
A few days ago, I stumbled upon an article in MIT Technology Review that stopped me in my tracks. It wasn’t about the latest AI breakthrough or a futuristic gadget—it was something far more profound and personal: the growing number of frozen embryos worldwide, sitting in cryopreservation tanks, caught in a strange limbo between potential life and uncertainty. The piece explored the ethical, legal, and emotional complexities surrounding these tiny clusters of cells, which hold so much promise yet remain shrouded in ambiguity. As someone who has always been fascinated by the intersection of science, ethics, and humanity, I couldn’t help but dive deeper into this topic.

What struck me most was how deeply polarizing the issue is. On one side, there are those who view embryos as nothing more than microscopic collections of cells—biological material with no intrinsic value until implanted into a uterus. On the other hand, some see them as nascent human beings, deserving of protection and care from the moment they’re created. And then, of course, there’s everyone else somewhere in between, grappling with questions that don’t have easy answers.

For couples undergoing IVF (in vitro fertilization), creating embryos often feels like a beacon of hope—a chance to fulfill dreams of parenthood after months or even years of struggle. But what happens when not all the embryos are used? What do you do with the extras—the ones left behind in liquid nitrogen tanks, suspended in time? Do you donate them to another family hoping for a child? Offer them up for scientific research? Or let them thaw and cease to exist?

These aren’t hypothetical scenarios; they’re real dilemmas faced by millions of people around the globe. In fact, estimates suggest there could be tens of millions of embryos currently stored worldwide, many of which may never find resolution. The reasons vary—some individuals simply can’t decide what to do, while others lose touch with the clinics storing their embryos. Some countries impose strict regulations that make disposal or donation nearly impossible. For example, in Italy, leftover embryos cannot be discarded, donated, or used for research. They must remain frozen indefinitely, creating what one lawyer described as “a psychological burden” for the parents involved
