## Introduction

Friedrich Nietzsche’s idea of the *Übermensch*—often translated as the "Overman" or "Superman"—is one of the most provocative and misunderstood concepts in modern philosophy. Meant to represent an individual who creates their own values and transcends conventional morality, the *Übermensch* has repeatedly surfaced in pop culture—but not always faithfully.

From comic book heroes to antiheroes like Walter White or Tony Stark, the cultural imagination tends to equate the *Übermensch* with power, charisma, and individual dominance. But Nietzsche’s vision was far more complex—and more philosophical.

## Who or What Is the Übermensch?

In *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, Nietzsche introduces the *Übermensch* as an ideal to strive toward in the wake of the “death of God.” Without divine moral authority, human beings must become the authors of their own values.

The *Übermensch*:
- Rejects herd morality and societal conventions
- Embraces the eternal recurrence (the idea of living life over and over)
- Lives with *amor fati*—love of one’s fate
- Is not bound by guilt, pity, or obedience to inherited norms

Importantly, the *Übermensch* is not a tyrant. Rather, they are someone who affirms life deeply and creatively, even its suffering.
