## Building My Own Spectrometer at the Astronuts DIY Spectroscopy Workshop üöÄ

I've always been fascinated by how light interacts with different materials, so when I heard about the **Astronuts: DIY Spectroscopy Workshop**, I knew I had to participate! This hands-on experience allowed me to construct my own **DIY spectrometer** and analyze light spectra firsthand. Here‚Äôs a recap of my experience.

## Why Spectroscopy? üåà

Spectroscopy is the study of how light is absorbed, emitted, or scattered by different materials. It plays a crucial role in:

- **Astronomy** ‚Äì Identifying the composition of stars and galaxies.
- **Forensics** ‚Äì Detecting materials in crime investigations.
- **Material Science** ‚Äì Studying the properties of different substances.

The idea of **analyzing light using a simple homemade device** was both exciting and educational.

## The Workshop üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Gathering Materials
Each participant received a kit with:
- A **CD/DVD** (for diffraction grating)
- A **cardboard box** (to house the spectrometer)
- A **slit for light entry** (made using a razor blade or foil)
- A **viewing tube** (to direct light into the grating)
- Tape, glue, and a flashlight

### Step 2: Constructing the Spectrometer
We assembled our spectrometers by:
1. Cutting a **small slit** in the box for light entry.
2. Placing the **CD/DVD** at an angle inside the box to act as a diffraction grating.
3. Attaching a **viewing tube** to observe the light spectrum.
4. Sealing any light leaks for better accuracy.

### Step 3: Observing Light Spectra ‚ú®

Once built, we tested our spectrometers by observing:
- **Incandescent bulbs** ‚Äì producing a continuous spectrum.
- **Fluorescent lights** ‚Äì showing discrete spectral lines.
- **LEDs and lasers** ‚Äì revealing unique spectral characteristics.
