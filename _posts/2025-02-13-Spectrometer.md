## Building My Own Spectrometer at the Astronuts DIY Spectroscopy Workshop 🚀  

I’ve always been fascinated by how light interacts with different materials, so when I heard about the **Astronuts: DIY Spectroscopy Workshop**, I knew I had to participate! This hands-on experience allowed me to construct my own **DIY spectrometer** and analyze light spectra firsthand.  

Here’s a recap of my experience.

## Why Spectroscopy? 🌈  

Spectroscopy is the study of how **light is absorbed, emitted, or scattered** by different materials. It plays a crucial role in:  

- **Astronomy** – Identifying the composition of stars and galaxies.  
- **Forensics** – Detecting materials in crime investigations.  
- **Material Science** – Studying the properties of different substances.  

The idea of analyzing light using a **simple homemade device** was both exciting and educational.

## The Workshop 🛠️  

### Step 1: Gathering Materials  

Each participant received a **DIY spectrometer kit** with:  

- **A CD piece** (broken into a circular shape, acting as the diffraction grating)  
- **A cylindrical cardboard roll** (forming the spectrometer body)  
- **Black tape** (to cover the inside and create a controlled light slit)  
- **Scissors** (for adjustments)

### Step 2: Constructing the Spectrometer  

We assembled our spectrometers as follows:  

1. **Cover the inside of the cardboard roll** with black tape to block unwanted light.  
2. **Seal one end** with black tape, leaving only a **narrow slit** for light entry.  
3. **Attach the CD piece** inside the tube at an angle so it diffracts incoming light.  
4. **Observe the spectrum** by looking through the open end.

### Step 3: Observing Light Spectra ✨  

Once built, we tested our spectrometers by analyzing different light sources:  

- **Incandescent bulbs** → Showed a **continuous spectrum**.  
- **Fluorescent lights** → Displayed **distinct spectral lines**.  
- **LEDs and lasers** → Produced unique spectra depending on their materials.
