## Introduction

What if skipping that coffee or movie night made you not just frugal—but moral? What if, according to one philosopher, doing otherwise made you *evil*?

That’s exactly the challenge Peter Singer poses. In his 1971 paper *Famine, Affluence, and Morality*, Singer argues that failing to donate our spare income to relieve suffering—like famine—makes us ethically blameworthy. Not just stingy. But wrong. Possibly evil.

This post is not just a summary of Singer’s ideas, but a personal attempt to sit with the discomfort they provoke. Because once you’ve read his argument, it’s difficult to unhear it.

## Who Is Peter Singer?

Peter Singer is an Australian moral philosopher, best known for his work in practical ethics. Rooted in utilitarianism, his views emphasize minimizing suffering and maximizing well-being—not just for humans, but for all sentient beings.

In *Famine, Affluence, and Morality*, Singer applies this framework to global poverty and hunger. His conclusion? If we can prevent suffering without sacrificing something of comparable moral worth, we are morally obligated to do so.
