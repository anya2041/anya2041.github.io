## Introduction

We live in an age of unprecedented awareness. With a single scroll, we can witness floods in Bangladesh, wildfires in Canada, and famine in Sudan. At any given moment, we are exposed to suffering—real, urgent, and overwhelming.

But here lies the paradox: the more we *know*, the less we *act*. Despite the flood of information, many of us remain morally stagnant, passive, or numb.

This post explores the troubling phenomenon of **moral fatigue**, also known as *compassion fatigue*—a growing inability to respond ethically to global crises due to emotional exhaustion, oversaturation, and digital distraction. It is a psychological and ethical condition born from the very tools designed to inform us.
